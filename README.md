## What this project is about

Natours is a mock web front for a nature tourism agency. This project demonstrates my knowledge with **Sass**, **responsive design**, **browser support**, **CSS architecture**, and **CSS animations**. I employ the **7-1 Sass architecture** and **BEM CSS methodology** throughout to organize my files. The website is also responsively designed to fit different screen widths and resolutions.

This project is modelled after Jonas Schmedtmann's [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) on Udemy.
